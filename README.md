# üìä TELCO CHURN PREDICTION
Welcome to the TELCO CHURN PREDICTION project! This repository contains a complete END-TO-END DATA SCIENCE WORKFLOW for analyzing and predicting CUSTOMER CHURN using the TELCO CUSTOMER DATASET.

CUSTOMER CHURN is a major concern for TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES, as retaining existing customers is far more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. In this project, we apply MACHINE LEARNING AND DATA ANALYTICS techniques to identify the key drivers of churn and build predictive models to forecast whether a customer is likely to leave the service.

### *Models are LogisticRegression,Randomforest , AdaBoost , votting classifier*

## **Imbalanced data handeled**

## üìå PROJECT OBJECTIVES
- Understand and explore the TELCO CUSTOMER DATA.

- Perform detailed EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA).

- Preprocess and clean the data for MODEL DEVELOPMENT.

- Train various MACHINE LEARNING MODELS.

- Evaluate model performance using metrics like ACCURACY, PRECISION, RECALL, and F1-SCORE.

- Draw business insights and highlight CHURN DRIVERS.
